CQG5DhEBMoh,https://www.instagram.com/p/CQG5DhEBMoh/,"40,348",,"The highs and the lows.  After a euphoric reunion in NYC , I came home because my very senior dog Momma was not well. She was at least 17 years old , we don’t really know because she was turned into the S.Central shelter with 5 new puppies 16 years ago. She was my survivor. The undisputed Queen of the house. She outlived her puppies and seemed to over come challenges with the ease of a much younger dog ( for  those who have been following , remember her broken leg ?). But in the horrible truth of life , dogs leave us too soon. I am proud to say that her transition to the other side was peaceful , the first time I have been able to achieve this with any of my fur babies. Yet still I am so so sad. Momma took care of me in so many ways. And I will miss everything about her. I am bereft.  I do have a vision of her with Sammy running free and happy and I ‘m trying to hold that in my mind and heart .  Thank you for 16 glorious years of joy and cuddling Momma. I ‘m not going to be able to do her big spirit justice here, but I wanted to honor her incredible life. I was lucky to have her for so long . Please Kiss someone you love today - furry or not- for Momma ❤️ Update- You are all truly overwhelming us with love !  Thank you , You all have helped me so much today 🙏🏼 👏👏😍😍😍😍 💔💔💔💔 So cute❤️ So beautiful ❤️ rest in peace Dear lovely dog.🐶  Dogs are a precious gift to us, i believe They Come to us When We need  them and They will Take care of us and give us so much love and happiness in life. They really are Amazing animals and it’s so hard to loose them. Perhaps their soal in a new dog goes to someone else who needs them .. ❤️ I love My little Charlie, cavalier🙏❤️🐶. ❤️🐾❤️ Made me tear up. I’ve lost two of my babies, miss them everyday. Love you girl. She looks so happy. ❤️ ❤️ 😢😢😢 RIP beautiful baby 💖 All 🐶🦮go to haven👏🙏💝💝💕 Condolences to the fuzzy hole in your heart and home. Gratitude that you both knew that special love. May her memory be a blessing. 🤍🐾 ❤️",,2021-06-14T16:41:46.000Z

Hanging out with elephant and human friends. To all of my newer followers , my friends and I had the most amazing experience in 2009 of rescuing an orphaned baby elephant and that is how I discovered   . I am forever humbled and in awe of the work they do to care for orphaned animals , conserve habitats and employ hundreds of exceptional humans in those efforts. I ‘m also so grateful for the intense love and support given by a global group who fosters 🐘 and generally lifts up the work of the Trust.  Since 2001 I have been lucky enough to travel to Kenya. And since then I have never gone this long without a trip there 😭. I miss it so much and look forward to the day I make it back ! What an experience we have all had this last year. Sending love to all ❤️       📷 Robert Carr-Hartley I so want to go with you sometime! 💚🐘 🐘💙🙏 Amazing work! ❤️ Just like in the movie Holiday in the Wild! That’s so amazing!!

I always ask to sponsor an Ellie for my birthday instead of gifts. I do hope someday to go to the wonderful Sheldrick Foundation and put in some physical labor for the elephants and rhinos there! Thank you for supporting the Ellie’s ♥️ They are beautiful gifts to the world. I’ve adopted many orphaned elephants through Sheldrick. They do amazing work. ❤️🐘 You look so peaceful in this picture!

I am the super annoying client who asks “why” when you tell me to do something. So really this man is a saint! Also, after gaining who knows how much weight from stress eating through the pandemic , I am thankful to have found a trainer who wasn’t going to make me get on a scale etc. and I really do feel better and so much stronger ! So thank you Keith 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️ Absolutely REFUSE to get on a scale. My jeans have let me know that I attained a “curvier” figure during COVID.
