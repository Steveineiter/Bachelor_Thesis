Especially the   was surely one of the highlights. Got so many impressions (like every year) and talked to so many great people. I was glad to pitch our startup idea there as well. Especially the talk from Matthew Banks, former VP Oracle, gave me chills, where he greatly challenged the status quo how we approach and react to problems. Currently immersed, a saying pops into my mind: ""Don't just think outside the box. Create a new one."" . . . . 📸           ",,2018-06-13T17:54:10.000Z

I was thrilled right from the beginning of their idea and vision. Therefore I've supported their crowdfunding campaign on   in 2016, which was a huge success and they've raised more than 60k. The first market could finally see the light of day. Four years later the unpredictable  event happened and we're altogether in this unique situation right now. Many many businesses and people are currently affected by the crisis and especially the regional small shops.    has mentioned in her very honest statement, what hardships they're currently facing, but they are trying their best to overcome this situation. So if you want to support our Austrian region, please take a look on their profile   and check out their online shop.

There was even a personal note included for saying ""Thx for your order. The beanie is hand-knitted with much love"" (or sth similar.

Couple of weeks ago, I was invited there to participate in a business pitch competition in front of a VC from NYC (amongst other startup experts), where I could pitch our lovely   and received great feedback for our business. And also gained an important contact from The States. I strongly believe in taking opportunities helps you to grow personally, which ultimately leads to more meaningful decisions and door openers. It's not taking risks, which often make us afraid and doubtful, but more the (financial) uncertainties, which lies ahead. But imho that's a constant struggle between the panic, the learning and the comfort zone, what entrepreneurs have. The art behind is to find out the right portion of every zone individually. Panic leads to negative stress and anxiety. Too much comfort often keeps you away from personal growth. Too much learning can be frustrating.               Wow! It was very good time! Grate teachers! Superpeople!!! 😊😊😊 👩",,2018-08-07T09:20:23.000Z
